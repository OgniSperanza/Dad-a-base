# Dad-a-base
Dad-a-base: The first and only stop for safe and reliable, ad-free, child care information for green and veteran fathers alike; Moms too ;)

# Vision
Dad-a-base is a free tool for parents to quickly check the safety and efficacy of ingredients, medicines, and parenting strategies. Dad-a-base is open-source, ad-free, and spawned from the core belief that the exploitation of parents and their children must end. Dad-a-base is meant to provide objective, factual information that is verified by the pediatric scientific communities, e.g. the efficacy and safety of vaccines. 

<b>The bottom line:</b> Dad-a-base is a tool for providing clear, reliable, no nonsense, sceintifically verifiable information for parents.
